# flutter_project2

A new Flutter project for learning

Leaning 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Learning Flutter application.

Building a Quiz App
In this course section, we will build another app: a quiz app. This app allows you to start a quiz and then navigate through various Flutter-related questions. The possible answers are displayed in random order. Once you have gone through all the questions, you receive a summary screen where you can see which questions were answered correctly and which ones were answered incorrectly. You can also restart the quiz if you want to.

As you can see, this app is a bit more advanced than what we built in the first course section. This makes sense since we are diving deeper into Flutter.

Learning Objectives
As we build this app and progress through this section, you will learn about additional, very common Flutter widgets that you should be aware of and how to use them. You will also learn about some new features of existing widgets which we already used in the previous section.

You will learn how to render conditional and list content, and what exactly that means. This will be very important since you will need these concepts in almost any Flutter app you build.

Overall, since we are building this slightly more complex app, you will gain an overview and understanding of how such more complex user interfaces can be built. By the end of this section, you will have a very solid Flutter toolbox which you can use to build Flutter apps. We will then use this toolbox to dive even deeper into Flutter after this section.

But now, to start, it is time to dive into this quiz app and explore more crucial Flutter concepts.

Key Takeaways
This course section focuses on building a quiz app using Flutter and Dart.
The quiz app features randomized answer order, a summary screen, and the ability to restart the quiz.
Learners will explore additional common Flutter widgets and new features of existing widgets.
The section emphasizes rendering conditional and list content, essential for most Flutter apps.
